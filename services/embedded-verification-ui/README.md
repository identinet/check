# Embedded Verification - User Interface

Widget that integrates the [Verification Service](../verification-service/) into
third-party websites.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via
`pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package
manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ just install
```
